/**
 * This component handles making the AI character automatically jump when necessary during navigation.
 *
 * The technique we are using here consists in two parts that go together :
 *
 * 1. Use jump height as step height in the NavMesh settings.
 *    By doing that, the NavMesh generates seamlessly over everything within jump height range, as if being a free-roaming flat surface.
 *    However with that alone, the bot will get stuck because it doesn't know when/how to jump.
 *
 * 2. Add a bit of tracing code to the AI, to figure out when to jump.
 *    This can be kept efficient as tracing doesn't need to happen every frame, and doesn't need to go very far.

 * This way we don't limit bot navigation to specific NavLink jump/falldown points which are incredibly inefficient.
 *
 * For falldown points that are outside of jump range, we will rely on either automatic generation (see UR_NavLinkGenerator_Falldown),
 * or manual placement of NavLinks.
 *
 * For jumping over holes in the ground, we still have to rely on manual placement of custum Jump links for now.
