/**
* NOTE:
*
* The firemode should provide boilerplate for implementing client side hit reg,
* without overloading the network with tick based RPCs.
*
* Thinking about following solution :
* - Server counts hits on its side
* - Client counts hits on its side
* - Every increment, client RPCs server with an unreliable call, with its current count
* - Server stores the last count received from client
* - When server receives a new count, compare to previous (new hits = count - last count)
* - Authorize all new hits up until client count > server count
*
* Problem: The final unreliable RPC(s) that didn't reach server, will be discarded.
* Problem: Alternating between two targets.
* Considering some packets will be lost, server essentially receives data in "chunks" (eg. new hits > 1).
* Possible solution: add additional reliable calls sent at a lower rate, with cumulated hits per player
*/

/*
* Second approach:
*
* Send more of a history with each RPC, but let server define checkpoints to reduce it.
* - Make a variable "ServerReceivedHitCount" replicated, so client knows what server received from him.
* - Every increment (or tick), client sends his entire history of new hits accumulated since ServerReceivedHitCount.
*
* ++ Should fix alternating between two targets.
* ++ If it continues sending repeatedly until server is up to date, should also fix the "last packet" problem.
* ++ If we add timestamps, server doesn't need to count, as it can rewind and check each hit.
*
* I like this approach but need to ensure it doesn't spam too much data.
* Timestamps might be a luxury we cannot afford, because it means sending each hit individually.
* Player with 100 ping hitting continuously will send a history of minimum 13 hits, without even packet loss.
* Without timestamps, we can simply send the hit count for each opponent. Much lighter.
* Investigate.
