/**
* NOTE: Here is a typical UE4 unpractical situation.
*
* When picked up, the pickup might not be relevant to everyone.
* For players whom it is relevant to, we want a multicast here to play effects and sounds.
*
* In parallel, we also want to multicast a global event for potential pickup announcement (powerup announcement / spectator pickup awareness).
*
* --------------------
*
* The traditional UT way is to replicate the pickup CLASS for the announcement, and use CDO data which is always available on clients.
* This is generally done by passing pickup class as OptionalObject for a LocalMessage.
* This is highly unpractical because the CDO cannot be customized in any way.
* A good example/use case would be for weapon-bases and/or dropped-weapon pickups.
* We dont want to prepare a XXXGunPickup & DroppedXXXGunPickup class for every single weapon.
* Rather, we want a single WeaponPickup & DroppedWeaponPickup class in which the weapon is a property, set at runtime.
* The CDO is useless in this case.
*
* To achieve this I want to try a slightly different approach.
* The idea is to force pickup relevancy to everyone upon pickup, just before destroying.
* Therefore we can have any amount of customizeable properties within pickup, to be replicated for the PickupEvent.
* There is also a side little advantage to this : we can do both things through a single replication channel.
*
* --------------------
*
* In retrospect, this is maybe a bit overkill.
* We should also take into account that the pickups that need to be broadcasted globally are only a small fraction of them.
* Example: When picking up ODamage, all spectators should see "X got ODamage" and we might also want an ingame announcement.
* However when picking up vials, weapons, or ammo, nobody cares except recipient and his direct spectators.
*
* Therefore for standard pickups we could stick to standard multicast, that would trigger only on relevant clients.
* It would trigger Recipient->PickupEvent (a character event, not a gamestate event), to be primarily used for UI pickup message.
*
* And then for specific pickups (powerups) we can add a second replication path for global pickup announcements through gamestate.
* This other path however will not have the Pickup object available due to possible lack of relevance, so we pass the class.
* As stated above passing the class prevents runtime customizability, but then again globally-announced pickups are sparse so it's a good compromise.
