# Setting Up Open Tournament

## What You Need to Get Started

* GitHub Account
* Epic Games Launcher
* Git Client
* Visual Studio 2019 (*C++ Developer Only*)

### GitHub Account

If you're reading this there's a good chance you already have a GitHub account, but if you don't then create an account on GitHub! 

### Epic Games Launcher

The Open Tournament project is built using Unreal Engine 4.25. Please ensure that you have the correct engine version installed.

* The correct engine version can be determined by looking at the OpenTournament.uproject from within a text editor. Find the line which says "EngineAssociation" and note the numerical value associated with it.
* The correct Unreal Engine version can be installed through the Epic Games Launcher. On the sidebar, select "Unreal Engine" then select the "Library" tab at the top. Select the "+" button next to Engine Versions and set it to the appropriate Engine version.

### Git Client

Git is a version control system utilized by GitHub & the Open Tournament project. The Git tool can be interfaced through using the command line, or using graphical frontends such as GitKraken, Git Fork or Sourcetree. Make sure you install Git with LFS support. Please refer to Git, GitHub, or your GUI client's tutorials on how to clone the Open Tournament repository.

### Visual Studio

> NOTE: If you are not a C++ developer, you should not need Visual Studio or any other C++ IDE. Double-click OpenTournament.uproject, and report back to us any issue in Discord.

* Refer to the [Unreal Engine 4 Documentation](
https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/Development/VisualStudioSetup/index.html) prior to setting up Visual Studio
* Download and Install Visual Studio 2019
* Within your cloned Open Tournament repository, right click on the OpenTournament.uproject
* Select "Generate Visual Studio project Files"
* Open the OpenTournament.sln file in Visual Studio
* Set solution configuration to `Development Editor` and platform to `Win64`
* Build the solution by opening the "Build" menu dropdown and selecting Build
* Once your initial project build is complete you should be able to double click on OpenTournament.uproject to open the project. This will display the Unreal Engine 4 Editor.

### Clone the Forked Repository

The second step, after you have created a fork, is to [clone the fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/). Cloning will create a copy of the repository on your computer. Once you have completed this step, you should be able to navigate to the location on your computer where the repository resides and see the Open Tournament project.

### Run OpenTournament.uproject

Contributing to Open Tournament is done through GitHub, using the Pull Request (PR) system.

Here is a simple [Guide to Submitting Pull Request](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/)

In the future, we will have a more defined process & workflow for certain types of content. However, for now here are some basic guidelines for pull requests:
* Reference an [Issue](https://github.com/OpenTournament/OpenTournament/issues) in every PR. Format should be OT-<IssueNumber>
* Try to make it easy to understand both the intent of your changes and the changes themselves.
* Limit Scope of PRs as much as possible
* If your PR contains any blueprint changes, please provide before/after screenshots of any changed logic.
* If your PR contains any blueprint changes, but these changes are value-only, a detailed summary of changes made (Old Value -> New Value) is sufficient.
* If your PR contains edits to materials, textures, or other visual content please provide screenshots & detailed summary of changes.
* If your PR contains edits to maps, please provide screenshots & detailed summary of changes.

Unfortunately while there is extra effort on the developer side, this is needed in order to keep the PR and review process manageable!
